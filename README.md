QuantMiner
==========

QuantMiner is a Data Mining tool for mining Quantitative Association Rules that is taking into consideration numerical attributes in the mining process without a binning/discretization a priori of the data. It exploits a recent and innovative research in using genetic algorithms for mining quantitative rules published in IJCAI 2007. We hope you will find it useful and welcome your feedback.
