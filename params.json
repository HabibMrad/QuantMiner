{"name":"QuantMiner","tagline":"","body":"QuantMiner\r\n==========\r\n\r\nQuantMiner is a Data Mining tool for mining Quantitative Association Rules that is taking into consideration numerical attributes in the mining process without a binning/discretization a priori of the data. It exploits a recent and innovative research in using genetic algorithms for mining quantitative rules published in IJCAI 2007. We hope you will find it useful and welcome your feedback.\r\n\r\nIf you publish material based on QuantMiner, then, please note the use of QuantMiner and its url. This will help others to obtain the system and replicate your experiments. We suggest the following reference format for referring to this software:\r\n\r\nSalleb-Aouissi, A. Vrain, C. Nortet, C.
